# iDiffuse
A tool to calculate expected diffuser-assisted photometric precisions.

# Features
With iDiffuse you can:

- Calculate the expected photometric precision of the ARCTIC diffuser system on the ARC 3.5m

- iDiffuse is easily extendable to calculate diffuser-assisted photometric precisions on other telescopes

- iDiffuse can be used to calculate the expected diffuserd PSF size in different telescope systems. You can also calculate the expected PSF sizes using the following online tool <a>here</a>.
