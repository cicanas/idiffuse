# iDiffuse: on-sky photometric precisions with diffusers
Welcome to the `iDiffuse` documentation, a Python package to calculate expected diffuser-assisted photometric precisions from the ground.

iDiffuse is currently heavily focused on calculating the diffuser-assisted photometric precision of ARCTIC on the ARC 3.5m Telescope at Apache Point Observatory. 

However, iDiffuse is written in a way that it is easy to modify and calculate diffuser-assisted photometric precisions for other telescopes.
